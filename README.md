# Python-Fundamental
Python for Everyone :)

Initially, I created this notebook just to teach my cousin how to program on Google Colab. Later on, I thought it might be a good idea to make this notebook free, so that it is accessible by anyone who is enthusiatic about Computer Science and Programming. It is intended for all levels of readers, but preferably high-school students, or freshman undergraduates. The notebook should covered adequate amount of contents which would normally be covered in an introductory undergraduate level Python programming course. The contents range from simple data types such as int, float, bool and string, to a more advanced data types also known as container such as list, tuple, set and dictionary, functions, recursion, and a bit of Object-Oriented Programming. Some of these features are Python-specific, whereas some are shared by most other programming languages. You can download the notebook and run locally, but you can do it via Google Collab. Everything else is open-source so feel free to do whatever you want with it. Have Fun! :)
