# Python-Fundamental
Python for Everyone :)

I created this notebook initially to teach my cousin how to write computer program in Python. Later on, I thought it might be a good idea to upload this notebook on my public repository, so that it is accessible by anyone who is enthusiatic about Computer Science and Programming. It is intended for all levels of readers, but preferably high-school students, or freshman undergraduates. The notebook should covered adequate amount of contents which would normally be covered in an introductory undergraduate level Python programming course. The contents range from simple data types such as int, float, bool and string, to a more advanced data types also known as container such as list, tuple, set and dictionary, functions, recursion, and a bit of Object-Oriented Programming. We don't covered algorithm and data structure here, so if you are looking for those, you should seek for more advanced materials. The objective of the notebook is to teach Python and basic computational thinking. Some of these features are Python-specific, whereas some are shared by most other programming languages. You can either download the notebook and run locally, or you can do it via Google Collab. Everything else is open-source so feel free to do whatever you want with it. Have Fun! :)
